Read Fireactjs Installation Guide.\nInstall from NPM The Fireactjs SaaS project comes with two packages: @fireacjts/saas for the Reactjs front-end and @fireactjs/saas-cloud-functions for the server-side Firebase Cloud Functions.\nIn your Reactjs app root folder, use the following command to install the @fireactjs/saas package:\nnpm i @fireactjs/saas In your /functions folder where your Firebase Cloud Functions are located, use the following command to install the @fireactjs/saas-cloud-functions package:\nnpm i @fireactjs/saas-cloud-functions Setup Payment Plans Fireactjs SaaS integrates with Stripe to handle subscription payments. You must have a Stripe account to enable the integration.\nIn Stripe, create a product for your SaaS. You can have multiple subscription plans, including both free and paid plans. Create a price plan under your subscription product for each plan. Stripe will create a price_id for each price plan.\nCreate a JSON file called plans.json in the /src folder and the /functions folder to describe the subscription plans of your SaaS product as the example shows below. The plans will be shown in the pricing table as the property values in the Reactjs application and will be used for the subscription process in the cloud functions. It’s important that the priceId property value of each plan matches the plan’s price_id in Stripe.\n[ { \"title\": \"Free\", \"popular\": false, \"priceId\": \"price_1...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 0, \"frequency\": \"week\", \"description\": [ \"10 users included\", \"2 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Email support\" ] }, { \"title\": \"Weekly\", \"popular\": true, \"priceId\": \"price_2...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 10, \"frequency\": \"week\", \"description\": [ \"20 users included\", \"10 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Priority email support\" ] }, { \"title\": \"Daily\", \"popular\": false, \"priceId\": \"price_3...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 5, \"frequency\": \"day\", \"description\": [ \"50 users included\", \"30 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Phone \u0026 email support\" ] } ] Setup Stripe Integration For the cloud functions to receive data from Stripe, you will need to create a webhook endpoint with the cloud function webhook URL https://firebse-location-project-id.cloudfunctions.net/fireactjsSaas-stripeWebHook. Please make sure you replace the domain with your actual Firebase project cloud function domain. Once the webhook is created, you will get an endpoint secret which is needed in the configuration file.\nThe following Stripe events need to be sent to the endpoint:\ncustomer.subscription.updated customer.subscription.trial_will_end customer.subscription.pending_update_expired customer.subscription.pending_update_applied customer.subscription.deleted customer.subscription.created invoice.created invoice.deleted invoice.finalized invoice.marked_uncollectible invoice.paid invoice.payment_action_required invoice.payment_failed invoice.payment_succeeded invoice.sent invoice.updated invoice.voided Create /src/config.json File Create a file called config.json in the /src folder as the example shows below store the configuration settings.\nTo integrate with Stripe, the Stripe public API key is required for the stripe.pubblic_api_key property.\nThe Reactjs application needs the price_id from Stripe to integrate with the Stripe payment plans. The plans will be shown in the pricing table as the property values in the JSON plans. It’s important that the priceId property value of each plan matches the plan’s price_id in Stripe.\n{ \"stripe\": { \"public_api_key\": \"pk_test_...\" }, \"plans\": [ { \"title\": \"Free\", \"popular\": false, \"priceId\": \"price_1...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 0, \"frequency\": \"week\", \"description\": [ \"10 users included\", \"2 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Email support\" ] }, { \"title\": \"Weekly\", \"popular\": true, \"priceId\": \"price_2...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 10, \"frequency\": \"week\", \"description\": [ \"20 users included\", \"10 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Priority email support\" ] }, { \"title\": \"Daily\", \"popular\": false, \"priceId\": \"price_3...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 5, \"frequency\": \"day\", \"description\": [ \"50 users included\", \"30 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Phone \u0026 email support\" ] } ], \"permissions\": { \"access\": { \"default\": true, \"admin\": false }, \"admin\": { \"default\": false, \"admin\": true } }, \"subscription\": { \"singular\": \"project\", \"plural\": \"projects\" } } Create /functions/config.json File In the /functions folder, create a config.json file as the example shows below.\nYou will need to put in the stripe secret API key and the endpoint secret in the configuration file to integrate the cloud functions with Stripe.\nPlans are also needed for the cloud functions similar to the Reactjs application.\nFor sending new user invites, the mailgun JSON is needed. The details are covered in the next section.\n{ \"brand\": \"My Brand\", \"site_name\": \"My SaaS App\", \"site_url\": \"https://app.mydomain.com\", \"sign_in_url\": \"https://app.mydomain.com/sign-in\", \"sign_up_url\": \"https://app.mydomain.com/sign-up\", \"stripe\": { \"secret_api_key\": \"sk_test_...\", \"end_point_secret\": \"whsec_...\" }, \"plans\": [ { \"title\": \"Free\", \"popular\": false, \"priceId\": \"price_1...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 0, \"frequency\": \"week\", \"description\": [ \"10 users included\", \"2 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Email support\" ] }, { \"title\": \"Weekly\", \"popular\": true, \"priceId\": \"price_2...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 10, \"frequency\": \"week\", \"description\": [ \"20 users included\", \"10 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Priority email support\" ] }, { \"title\": \"Daily\", \"popular\": false, \"priceId\": \"price_3...\", \"currency\": \"$\", \"price\": 5, \"frequency\": \"day\", \"description\": [ \"50 users included\", \"30 GB of storage\", \"Help center access\", \"Phone \u0026 email support\" ] } ], \"permissions\": { \"access\": { \"default\": true, \"admin\": false }, \"admin\": { \"default\": false, \"admin\": true } }, \"mailgun\": { \"api_key\": \"...\", \"domain\": \"app.mydomain.com\", \"from\": \"No Reply \u003cno-reply@app.mydomain.com\u003e\", \"templates\":{ \"invite_email\": \"invite\" } } } Setup Mailgun Integration (optional) The framework integrates with Mailgun to send invite emails when users are invited to join subscription accounts. To setup the integration, retrieve the API key from Mailgun and create a file called mailgun.json under the src folder as the example below shows.\n{ \"api_key\": \"...\", \"domain\": \"app.mydomain.com\", \"from\": \"No Reply \u003cno-reply@app.mydomain.com\u003e\", \"templates\":{ \"invite_email\": \"invite\" } In Mailgun, you will need a template for the invite emails. Create a template called invite with the subject line below.\n{{sender}} invited you to {{site_name}} In the template body, use the following copy.\nHi {{name}}, You received this invite because {{sender}} invited you to join {{site_name}}. Please sign in ({{sign_in_url}}) to accept the invite. If you don't have a user account yet, please sign up ({{sign_up_url}}) here. Best regards, The {{site_name}} team The invite template supports the following variables:\n{{sender}} - the name of the person who sends the invite {{site_name}} - the name of your web application defined in the cloud function configurations {{name}} - the name of the new user who is invited by the sender {{sign_in_url}} - the URL to the sign-in page which is defined in the cloud function configurations {{sign_up_url}} - the URL to the sign-up page which is defined in the cloud function configurations Note: The invite email is optional for the invite process. You can skip this step but the new users will need to be informed by other methods so that they know where to sign up and sign in to accept the invites.\nUpdate Firestore Rules The SaaS package uses Firestore database to store and manage the subscription data. To secure the data, the following Firestore rules need to be added to your Firestore database rules.\nmatch /users/{userId}/paymentMethods/{paymentMethodId} { allow read, update, create, delete: if request.auth.uid == userId; } match /subscriptions/{subscriptionId} { allow read: if request.auth.uid != null \u0026\u0026 request.auth.uid in resource.data.permissions.access; allow update: if request.auth.uid != null \u0026\u0026 request.auth.uid in resource.data.permissions.admin \u0026\u0026 (!request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys() .hasAny(['currency', 'ownerId', 'paymentCycle', 'paymentMethod', 'plan', 'price', 'stripePriceId', 'stripeSubscriptionId', 'subscriptionCreated', 'subscriptionCurrentPeriodEnd', 'subscriptionCurrentPeriodStart', 'subscriptionEnded', 'subscriptionStatus'])); } match /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/invoices/{invoiceId} { allow read: if request.auth.uid != null \u0026\u0026 request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/subscriptions/$(subscriptionId)).data.permissions.admin;

This variable tells the system if the current user has signed in or not as well as the relevant data about the user.\nRoutes Within the \u003cAuthProvider /\u003e component are routes for your application. It is important to have a good understanding of React Router. There are two kinds of routes you will find: the layout routes without the path prop and the page routes with the path prop.\nAll the pages that only authenticated users can access should be placed under the route of the \u003cAuthRoutes /\u003e component. And within the component, you can have template routes to control the look and feel of your application. The \u003cAppTemplate /\u003e component is an example.\nOutside of the \u003cAuthRoutes /\u003e component are the pages that the users can access without authentication, such as the sign-in page, the sign-up page, etc. They can have their own templates similar to the authenticated pages. The \u003cPublicTemplate /\u003e component is an example.\nPage components Each route mapping to a page requires a visual component for its element prop. For example, the \u003cUserProfle /\u003e component shows the user profile details. You can add new routes for new pages and features of your application, or swap the existing routes with your custom-built components to change their functionality.\nPathnames Within the page components, there are links between the pages to build a smooth user flow experience. It’s important that the page components know how to link with each other, and that is the purpose of the pathnames.json file. This file defines all the page components and their URL path names as a JSON file.\nHere is an example of the default pathnames.json file from the framework.\n{ \"ResetPassword\": \"/reset-password\", \"SignIn\": \"/sign-in\", \"SignUp\": \"/sign-up\", \"UserDelete\": \"/user/delete\", \"UserProfile\": \"/user\", \"UserUpdateEmail\": \"/user/update-email\", \"UserUpdateName\": \"/user/update-name\", \"UserUpdatePassword\": \"/user/update-password\" } FireactProvider component This is the component to provide the configurations as a context variable. The config property is a JSON object that you can extend its properties.
